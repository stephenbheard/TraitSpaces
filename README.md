TraitSpaces
===========

Software from Heard 2012 International Journal of Ecology 2013:192345

Three options:

1. Download the Visual Basic code as a text file
2. Download all the files needed to open, modify, or run the project in Visual Basic (TraitSpaces120.zip)
3. Download and install an executable version to your Windows computer (Installation.zip, unpack and start with publish.html)

Note: This software works, but the input and output are epically user-unfriendly. A new version is in development; but in the meantime, please contact me for assistance getting the damn thing to run.

Cheers,

Steve Heard
